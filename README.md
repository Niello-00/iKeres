Experimental Latency Reduction Script(s) for Real-Time Applications in Windows OS Enviornments
Currently Only Testing Build Version(s): (23H2)

If viewing on or shortly afterwards of (12/18/2023 | 18-December-2023)
Please check back by ~(01/01/2024 | 01-January-2024) for a Status Update.

I have largely, admittedly, kept my Optimization Scripting to my-self, 
Only out of respect towards other'(s), Computer(s).

I have likely Re-Installed at least > 100 different OS builds in the past 12 months to ensure Quality on my PC.

I am hoping to target Dx11-DX12 applications for Latency Reduction Purposes in Real-Time Gaming. 

I will update accordingly within due time,
If there is a delay, I will make it my best effort(s), to ensure not to waste your viewer(s) time.

Happy Holidays,
To The World,

Yet, Realistically,
I do not like shadows.

I am humbly of the opinion, 
Love to be found in the Strangest of Places. 

Sorry for wasting your time :( shadows.
